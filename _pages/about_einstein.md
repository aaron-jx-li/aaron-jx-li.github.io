I am currently a second-year Master's student in Computational Science and Engineering at Harvard University, advised by Prof. [Hima Lakkaraju](https://himalakkaraju.github.io). Previously, I graduated from UC Berkeley with a double major in Computer Science and Psychology, where I also collaborated Prof. [Bin Yu](https://binyu.stat.berkeley.edu/) as part of the EECS Honors Program.
