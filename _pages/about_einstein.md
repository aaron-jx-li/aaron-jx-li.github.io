I am currently a second-year Master's student in Computational Science and Engineering at Harvard University, and I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Hima Lakkaraju](https://himalakkaraju.github.io). Previously, I graduated from UC Berkeley with a double major in Computer Science and Psychology, where I also collaborated with Prof. [Bin Yu](https://binyu.stat.berkeley.edu/) as part of the EECS Honors Program. 


I'm broadly interested in the intersections of Trustworthy Machine Learning, Large Language Models, and Mechanistic Interpretability. The two overarching research questions I aim to address are:

(1) How could we obtain reliable interpretations of learning dynamics and explanations of observed model behaviors?

(2) How could we leverage such understanding to improve next-generation foundation models?
